# EXTRA SECTIONS
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can define your own charts, you choose here what are rows and columns
# keys. This feature is particularly useful for marketing purpose, tracking
# products orders for example.
# For this, edit all parameters of Extra section. Each set of parameter is a
# different chart. For several charts, duplicate section changing the number.
# Note: Each Extra section reduces AWStats speed by 8%.
#
# WARNING: A wrong setup of Extra section might result in too large arrays
# that will consume all your memory, making AWStats unusable after several
# updates, so be sure to setup it correctly.
# In most cases, you don't need this feature.
#
# ExtraSectionNameX is title of your personalized chart.
# ExtraSectionCodeFilterX is list of codes the record code field must match.
#   Put an empty string for no test on code.
# ExtraSectionConditionX are conditions you can use to count or not the hit,
#   Use one of the field condition
#   (URL,URLWITHQUERY,QUERY_STRING,REFERER,UA,HOSTINLOG,HOST,VHOST,extraX)
#   and a regex to match, after a coma. Use "||" for "OR".
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitleX is the first column title of the chart.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnValuesX is a string to tell AWStats which field to
#   extract value from
#   (URL,URLWITHQUERY,QUERY_STRING,REFERER,UA,HOSTINLOG,HOST,VHOST,extraX)
#   and how to extract the value (using regex syntax). Each different value
#   found will appear in first column of report on a different row. Be sure
#   that list of different possible values will not grow indefinitely.
# ExtraSectionFirstColumnFormatX is the string used to write value.
# ExtraSectionStatTypesX are things you want to count. You can use standard
#   code letters (P for pages,H for hits,B for bandwidth,L for last access).
# ExtraSectionAddAverageRowX add a row at bottom of chart with average values.
# ExtraSectionAddSumRowX add a row at bottom of chart with sum values.
# MaxNbOfExtraX is maximum number of rows shown in chart.
# MinHitExtraX is minimum number of hits required to be shown in chart.
#

# Example to report the 20 products the most ordered by "order.cgi" script
#ExtraSectionName1="Product orders"
#ExtraSectionCodeFilter1="200 304"
#ExtraSectionCondition1="URL,\/cgi\-bin\/order\.cgi||URL,\/cgi\-bin\/order2\.cgi"
#ExtraSectionFirstColumnTitle1="Product ID"
#ExtraSectionFirstColumnValues1="QUERY_STRING,productid=([^&]+)"
#ExtraSectionFirstColumnFormat1="%s"
#ExtraSectionStatTypes1=PL
#ExtraSectionAddAverageRow1=0
#ExtraSectionAddSumRow1=1
#MaxNbOfExtra1=20
#MinHitExtra1=1


# There is also a global parameter ExtraTrackedRowsLimit that limits the
# number of possible rows an ExtraSection can report. This parameter is
# here to protect too much memory use when you make a bad setup in your
# ExtraSection. It applies to all ExtraSection independently meaning that
# none ExtraSection can report more rows than value defined by ExtraTrackedRowsLimit.
# If you know an ExtraSection will report more rows than its value, you should
# increase this parameter or AWStats will stop with an error.
# Example: 2000
# Default: 500
#
ExtraTrackedRowsLimit=500
