# OPTIONAL SETUP SECTION (Not required but increase AWStats features)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# When the update process runs, AWStats can set a lock file in TEMP or TMP
# directory. This lock is to avoid to have 2 update processes running at the
# same time to prevent unknown conflicts problems and avoid DoS attacks when
# AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser is set to 1.
# Because, when you use lock file, you can experience sometimes problems in
# lock file not correctly removed (killed process for example requires that
# you remove the file manualy), this option is not enabled by default (Do
# not enable this option with no console server access).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
EnableLockForUpdate=1


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a static DNS cache file that was
# previously created manually. If no path is given in static DNS cache file
# name, AWStats will search DirData directory. This file is never changed.
# This option is not used if DNSLookup=0.
# Note: DNS cache file format is 'minsince1970 ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# or just 'ipaddress resolved_hostname'
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscache"
# Default: "dnscache.txt"
#
DNSStaticCacheFile="dnscache.txt"


# AWStats can do reverse DNS lookups through a DNS cache file that was created
# by a previous run of AWStats. This file is erased and recreated after each
# statistics update process. You don't need to create and/or edit it.
# AWStats will read and save this file in DirData directory.
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: If a DNSStaticCacheFile is available, AWStats will check for DNS
# lookup in DNSLastUpdateCacheFile after checking into DNSStaticCacheFile.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "/mydnscachedir/dnscachelastupdate"
# Default: "dnscachelastupdate.txt"
#
DNSLastUpdateCacheFile="dnscachelastupdate.txt"


# You can specify specific IP addresses that should NOT be looked up in DNS.
# This option is used only if DNSLookup=1.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "123.123.123.123 REGEX[^192\.168\.]"
# Default: ""
#
SkipDNSLookupFor=""


# The following two parameters allow you to protect a config file from being
# read by AWStats when called from a browser if web user has not been
# authenticated. Your AWStats program must be in a web protected "realm" (With
# Apache, you can use .htaccess files to do so. With other web servers, see
# your server setup manual).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly=0


# This parameter gives the list of all authorized authenticated users to view
# statistics for this domain/config file. This parameter is used only if
# AllowAccessFromWebToAuthenticatedUsersOnly is set to 1.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Example: "user1 user2"
# Example: "__REMOTE_USER__"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingAuthenticatedUsers=""


# When this parameter is defined to something, the IP address of the user that
# reads its statistics from a browser (when AWStats is used as a CGI) is
# checked and must match one of the IP address values or ranges.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Example: "127.0.0.1 123.123.123.1-123.123.123.255"
# Default: ""
#
AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingIPAddresses=""


# If the "DirData" directory (see above) does not exist, AWStats return an
# error. However, you can ask AWStats to create it.
# This option can be used by some Web Hosting Providers that has defined a 
# dynamic value for DirData (for example DirData="/home/__REMOTE_USER__") and
# don't want to have to create a new directory each time they add a new user.
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
CreateDirDataIfNotExists=0


# You can choose in which format the Awstats history database is saved.
# Note: Using "xml" format make AWStats building database files three times
# larger than using "text" format.
# Change : Database format is switched after next update
# Possible values: text or xml
# Default: text
#
BuildHistoryFormat=text


# If you prefer having the report output pages be built as XML compliant pages
# instead of simple HTML pages, you can set this to 'xhtml' (May not work
# properly with old browsers).
# Change : Effective immediatly
# Possible values: html or xhtml
# Default: html
#
BuildReportFormat=html


# AWStats databases can be updated from command line of from a browser (when
# used as a cgi program). So AWStats database files need write permission
# for both command line user and default web server user (nobody for Unix,
# IUSR_xxx for IIS/Windows,...).
# To avoid permission problems between update process (run by an admin user)
# and CGI process (ran by a low level user), AWStats can save its database 
# files with read and write permissions for everyone.
# By default, AWStats keeps default user permissions on updated files. If you 
# set AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser to 1, you can change this parameter to 1.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
SaveDatabaseFilesWithPermissionsForEveryone=0


# AWStats can purge log file, after analyzing it. Note that AWStats is able
# to detect new lines in a log file, to process only them, so you can launch
# AWStats as often as you want, even with this parameter to 0.
# With 0, no purge is made, so you must use a scheduled task or a web server
# that make this purge frequently.
# With 1, the purge of the log file is made each time AWStats update is run.
# This parameter doesn't work with IIS (This web server doesn't let its log
# file to be purged).
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
PurgeLogFile=0


# When PurgeLogFile is setup to 1, AWStats will clean your log file after
# processing it. You can however keep an archive file of all processed log
# records by setting this parameter (For example if you want to use another
# log analyzer). The archived log file is saved in "DirData" with name
# awstats_archive.configname[.suffix].log
# This parameter is not used if PurgeLogFile=0
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0, 1, or tags (See LogFile parameter) for suffix
# Example: 1
# Example: %YYYY%MM%DD
# Default: 0
#
ArchiveLogRecords=0


# Each time you run the update process, AWStats overwrites the 'historic file'
# for the month (awstatsMMYYYY[.*].txt) with the updated one.
# When write errors occurs (IO, disk full,...), this historic file can be
# corrupted and must be deleted. Because this file contains information of all
# past processed log files, you will loose old stats if removed. So you can
# ask AWStats to save last non corrupted file in a .bak file. This file is
# stored in "DirData" directory with other 'historic files'.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
KeepBackupOfHistoricFiles=0


# Default index page name for your web server.
# Change : Effective for new updates only
# Example: "index.php index.html default.html"
# Default: "index.php index.html"
#
DefaultFile="index.php index.html"


# Do not include access from clients that match following criteria.
# If your log file contains IP addresses in host field, you must enter here
# matching IP addresses criteria.
# If DNS lookup is already done in your log file, you must enter here hostname
# criteria, else enter ip address criteria.
# The opposite parameter of "SkipHosts" is "OnlyHosts".
# Note: Use space between each value. This parameter is not case sensitive.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
