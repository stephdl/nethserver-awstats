# AWSTATS CONFIGURE FILE 7.3
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file into awstats.www.mydomain.conf and edit this new config file
# to setup AWStats (See documentation in docs/ directory).
# The config file must be in /etc/awstats, /usr/local/etc/awstats or /etc (for
# Unix/Linux) or same directory than awstats.pl (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux...)
# To include an environment variable in any parameter (AWStats will replace
# it with its value when reading it), follow the example:
# Parameter="__ENVNAME__"
# Note that environment variable AWSTATS_CURRENT_CONFIG is always defined with
# the config value in an AWStats running session and can be used like others.

# MAIN SETUP SECTION (Required to make AWStats work)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "LogFile" contains the web, ftp or mail server log file to analyze.
# Possible values: A full path, or a relative path from awstats.pl directory.
# Example: "/var/log/apache/access.log"
# Example: "../logs/mycombinedlog.log"
# You can also use tags in this filename if you need a dynamic file name
# depending on date or time (Replacement is made by AWStats at the beginning
# of its execution). This is available tags :
#   %YYYY-n  is replaced with 4 digits year we were n hours ago
#   %YY-n    is replaced with 2 digits year we were n hours ago
#   %MM-n    is replaced with 2 digits month we were n hours ago
#   %MO-n    is replaced with 3 letters month we were n hours ago
#   %DD-n    is replaced with day we were n hours ago
#   %HH-n    is replaced with hour we were n hours ago
#   %NS-n    is replaced with number of seconds at 00:00 since 1970
#   %WM-n    is replaced with the week number in month (1-5)
#   %Wm-n    is replaced with the week number in month (0-4)
#   %WY-n    is replaced with the week number in year (01-52)
#   %Wy-n    is replaced with the week number in year (00-51)
#   %DW-n    is replaced with the day number in week (1-7, 1=sunday)
#                              use n=24 if you need (1-7, 1=monday)
#   %Dw-n    is replaced with the day number in week (0-6, 0=sunday)
#                              use n=24 if you need (0-6, 0=monday)
#   Use 0 for n if you need current year, month, day, hour...
# Example: "/var/log/access_log.%YYYY-0%MM-0%DD-0.log"
# Example: "C:/WINNT/system32/LogFiles/W3SVC1/ex%YY-24%MM-24%DD-24.log"
# You can also use a pipe if log file come from a pipe :
# Example: "gzip -cd /var/log/apache/access.log.gz |"
# If there are several log files from load balancing servers :
# Example: "/pathtotools/logresolvemerge.pl *.log |"
#
LogFile="/var/log/httpd/access.{{$ServerName}}.log"

# Enter the log file type you want to analyze.
# Possible values:
#  W - For a web log file
#  S - For a streaming log file
#  M - For a mail log file
#  F - For a ftp log file
# Example: W
# Default: W
#
LogType=W


# Enter here your log format (Must match your web server config. See setup
# instructions in documentation to know how to configure your web server to
# have the required log format).
# Possible values: 1,2,3,4 or "your_own_personalized_log_format"
# 1 - Apache or Lotus Notes/Domino native combined log format (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format)
# 2 - IIS or ISA format (IIS W3C log format). See FAQ-COM115 For ISA.
# 3 - Webstar native log format.
# 4 - Apache or Squid native common log format (NCSA common/CLF log format)
#     With LogFormat=4, some features (browsers, os, keywords...) can't work.
# "your_own_personalized_log_format" = If your log is ftp, mail or other format,
#     you must use following keys to define the log format string (See FAQ for
#     ftp, mail or exotic web log format examples):
#   %host             Client hostname or IP address (or Sender host for mail log)
#   %host_r           Receiver hostname or IP address (for mail log)
#   %lognamequot      Authenticated login/user with format: "john"

#   %time1            Date and time with format: [dd/mon/yyyy:hh:mm:ss +0000] or [dd/mon/yyyy:hh:mm:ss]
#   %time2            Date and time with format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
#   %time3            Date and time with format: Mon dd hh:mm:ss or Mon dd hh:mm:ss yyyy
#   %time4            Date and time with unix timestamp format: dddddddddd
#   %time5            Date and time with format iso: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss

#   %method           Method with format: GET
#   %url              URL only with format: /index.html
#   %query            Query string (used by URLWithQuery option)
#   %code             Return code status (with format for web log: 999)
#   %bytesd           Size of document in bytes
#   %refererquot      Referer page with format: "http://from.com/from.htm"
#   %referer          Referer page with format: http://from.com/from.htm

#   %ua               User agent with format: Mozilla/4.0_(compatible...)
#   %gzipin           mod_gzip compression input bytes: In:XXX
#   %gzipout          mod_gzip compression output bytes & ratio: Out:YYY:ZZpct.
#   %gzipratio        mod_gzip compression ratio: ZZpct.
#   %deflateratio     mod_deflate compression ratio with format: (ZZ)
#   %email            EMail sender (for mail log)
#   %email_r          EMail receiver (for mail log)
#   %virtualname      Web sever virtual hostname. Use this tag when same log
#                     contains data of several virtual web servers. AWStats
#                     will discard records not in SiteDomain nor HostAliases
#   %cluster          If log file is provided from several computers (merged by
#                     logresolvemerge.pl), use this to define cluster id field.
#   %extraX           Another field that you plan to use for building a
#                     personalized report with ExtraSection feature (See later).
#   If your log format has some fields not included in this list, use:
#   %other            Means another not used field
#   %otherquot        Means another not used double quoted field
#
# Examples for Apache combined logs (following two examples are equivalent):
# LogFormat = 1
# LogFormat = "%host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
#
# Example for IIS:
# LogFormat = 2
#
LogFormat=1


# If your log field's separator is not a space, you can change this parameter.
# This parameter is not used if LogFormat is a predefined value (1,2,3,4)
# Backslash can be used as escape character.
# Example: " "
# Example: "\t"
# Example: "\|"
# Example: ","
# Default: " "
#
LogSeparator=" "


# "SiteDomain" must contain the main domain name, or the main intranet web
# server name, used to reach the web site.
# If you share the same log file for several virtual web servers, this
# parameter is used to tell AWStats to filter record that contains records for
# this virtual host name only (So check that this virtual hostname can be
# found in your log file and use a personalized log format that include the
# %virtualname tag).
# But for multi hosting a better solution is to have one log file for each
# virtual web server. In this case, this parameter is only used to generate
# full URL's links when ShowLinksOnUrl option is set to 1.
# If analyzing mail log, enter here the domain name of mail server.
# Example: "myintranetserver"
# Example: "www.domain.com"
# Example: "ftp.domain.com"
# Example: "domain.com"
#
SiteDomain="{{$ServerName}}"


# Enter here all other possible domain names, addresses or virtual host
# aliases someone can use to access your site. Try to keep only the minimum
# number of possible names/addresses to have the best performances.
# You can repeat the "SiteDomain" value in this list.
# This parameter is used to analyze referer field in log file and to help
# AWStats to know if a referer URL is a local URL of same site or an URL of
# another site.
# Note: Use space between each value.
# Note: You can use regular expression values writing value with REGEX[value].
# Note: You can also use @/mypath/myfile if list of aliases are in a file.
# Example: "www.myserver.com localhost 127.0.0.1 REGEX[mydomain\.(net|org)$]"
#
HostAliases="{{$ServerName}}"

# If you want to have hosts reported by name instead of ip address, AWStats
# need to make reverse DNS lookups (if not already done in your log file).
# With DNSLookup to 0, all hosts will be reported by their IP addresses and
# not by the full hostname of visitors (except if names are already available
# in log file).
# If you want/need to set DNSLookup to 1, don't forget that this will reduce
# dramatically AWStats update process speed. Do not use on large web sites.
# Note: Reverse DNS lookup is done on IPv4 only (Enable ipv6 plugin for IPv6).
# Note: Result of DNS Lookup can be used to build the Country report. However
# it is highly recommanded to enable the plugin 'geoip' or 'geoipfree' to
# have an accurate Country report with no need of DNS Lookup.
# Possible values:
# 0 - No DNS Lookup
# 1 - DNS Lookup is fully enabled
# 2 - DNS Lookup is made only from static DNS cache file (if it exists)
# Default: 2
# 
{
my $lookup = $awstats{'DnsLookup'} || 'disabled';
if ($lookup eq 'enabled') {
    $OUT .= 'DNSLookup=1';
}
else {
    $OUT .= 'DNSLookup=0';
}
}

# When AWStats updates its statistics, it stores results of its analysis in 
# files (AWStats database). All those files are written in the directory
# defined by the "DirData" parameter. Set this value to the directory where
# you want AWStats to save its database and working files into.
# Warning: If you want to be able to use the "AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser"
# feature (see later), you need "Write" permissions by web server user on this
# directory (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Example: "/var/lib/awstats"
# Example: "../data"
# Example: "C:/awstats_data_dir"
# Default: "."          (means same directory as awstats.pl)
#
DirData="/var/lib/awstats"


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats cgi-bin directory.
# This parameter is used only when AWStats is run from command line
# with -output option (to generate links in HTML reported page).
# Example: "/awstats"
# Default: "/cgi-bin"   (means awstats.pl is in "/yourwwwroot/cgi-bin")
#
DirCgi="/awstats"


# Relative or absolute web URL of your awstats icon directory.
# If you build static reports ("... -output > outputpath/output.html"), enter
# path of icon directory relative to the output directory 'outputpath'.
# Example: "/awstatsicons"
# Example: "../icon"
# Default: "/icon" (means you must copy icon directories in "/mywwwroot/icon")
#
DirIcons="/awstatsicons"


# When this parameter is set to 1, AWStats adds a button on report page to
# allow to "update" statistics from a web browser. Warning, when "update" is
# made from a browser, AWStats is run as a CGI by the web server user defined
# in your web server (user "nobody" by default with Apache, "IUSR_XXX" with
# IIS), so the "DirData" directory and all already existing history files
# awstatsMMYYYY[.xxx].txt must be writable by this user. Change permissions if
# necessary to "Read/Write" (and "Modify" for Windows NTFS file systems).
# Warning: Update process can be long so you might experience "time out"
# browser errors if you don't launch AWStats frequently enough.
# When set to 0, update is only made when AWStats is run from the command
# line interface (or a task scheduler).
# Possible values: 0 or 1
# Default: 0
#
AllowToUpdateStatsFromBrowser=0


# AWStats saves and sorts its database on a month basis (except if using
# databasebreak option from command line). 
# However, if you choose the -month=all from command line or
# value '-Year-' from CGI combo form to have a report for all year, AWStats
# needs to reload all data for full year (each month), and sort them,
# requiring a large amount of time, memory and CPU. This might be a problem
# for web hosting providers that offer AWStats for large sites, on shared
# servers, to non CPU cautious customers.
# For this reason, the 'full year' is only enabled on Command Line by default.
# You can change this by setting this parameter to 0, 1, 2 or 3.
# Possible values:
#  0 - Never allowed
#  1 - Allowed on CLI only, -Year- value in combo is not visible
#  2 - Allowed on CLI only, -Year- value in combo is visible but not allowed
#  3 - Possible on CLI and CGI
# Default: 2
#
AllowFullYearView=3
