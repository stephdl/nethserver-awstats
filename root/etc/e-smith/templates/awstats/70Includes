# You can include other config files using the directive with the name of the
# config file.
# This is particularly useful for users who have a lot of virtual servers, so
# a lot of config files and want to maintain common values in only one file.
# Note that when a variable is defined both in a config file and in an
# included file, AWStats will use the last value read for parameters that
# contains one value and AWStats will concat all values from both files for
# parameters that are lists of values.
